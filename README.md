What Done:
1. Register user
2. Login user
3. Check mail in clearbit.com during registration
4. Check mail in emailhunter.co during registration
5. Using DB sqlite3

5. REST API
5.1 Can use CRUD for Post

What didn't:
1. Post like
2. Post unlike
3. Unit test

---------

Separately, tables are created taking into account the REST API and tables taking into account registration.

You can create POST from the administrator of the REST API, and they are tied to a specific user.
How to do this on a regular HTML page, so that when a user logs in, everything is displayed there, I do not understand... yet


It's my first time when i used (and worked) with Django + REST API.

I used articles:

2. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12597780/how-can-i-hide-a-django-label-in-a-custom-django-form/12599168

And of course - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/
